* Go Translate

This is a translation framework on Emacs, with high configurability and extensibility.

[[README-zh.org][点击查看《中文版文档》]]

As a translation framework, it offers many advantages:
- Supports multiple translation engines, including ChatGPT, Bing, Google, DeepL, YoudaoDict, StarDict, LibreTranslate and more.
- Rich rendering components, such as rendering to Buffer, Posframe, Overlay, Kill Ring, and others. With stream output support.
- Flexible retrieval of content and language for translation, with the help of the built-in Taker component.
- Support for word and sentence translation, as well as translation of multiple paragraphs. It can use multiple engines concurrently to translate multiple paragraphs into multiple languages.
- Support for different HTTP backends (url.el, curl) with asynchronous and non-blocking requests, providing a smooth user experience. Support independent proxy configs.
- Implemented based on eieio (CLOS), allowing users to flexibly configure and extend the various components.

It's more than just a translation framework.It's flexible, and can easily be extended to various Text-to-Text conversion scenarios:
- For example, the built-in Text-Utility component integrates text encryption/decryption, hashing, QR code generation, etc.
- For example, it can be extended as a client for ChatGPT (WIP)

** Installation

Download and load this package via MELPA or other ways.

** Basic Usage (as a Translator)

For the most basic use, add the following code to the configuration file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq gt-langs '(en fr))
  (setq gt-default-translator (gt-translator :engines (gt-google-engine)))

  ;; This configuration means:
  ;; Initialize the default translator, let it translate between en and fr via Google Translate,
  ;; and the result will be displayed in the Echo Area.
#+end_src

Then select a certain text, and start translation with command =gt-translate=.

Of course, it is possible to specify more options for the translator, such as:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator
         :taker   (gt-taker :text 'buffer :pick 'paragraph)  ; config the Taker
         :engines (list (gt-bing-engine) (gt-google-engine)) ; specify the Engines
         :render  (gt-buffer-render)))                       ; config the Render

  ;; This configuration means:
  ;; Initialize the default translator, let it send all paragraphs in the buffer to Bing and Google,
  ;; and output the results with a new Buffer.
#+end_src

Except config default translator with =gt-default-translator=, you can define several preset translators with =gt-preset-translators=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq gt-preset-translators
        `((ts-1 . ,(gt-translator
                    :taker (gt-taker :langs '(en fr) :text 'word)
                    :engines (gt-bing-engine)
                    :render (gt-overlay-render)))
          (ts-2 . ,(gt-translator
                    :taker (gt-taker :langs '(en fr ru) :text 'sentence)
                    :engines (gt-google-engine)
                    :render (gt-insert-render)))
          (ts-3 . ,(gt-translator
                    :taker (gt-taker :langs '(en fr) :text 'buffer
                                     :pick 'word :pick-pred (lambda (w) (length> w 6)))
                    :engines (gt-google-engine)
                    :render (gt-overlay-render :type 'help-echo)))))
#+end_src

This configuration presets three translators:
- *ts-1*: translate word or selected region near the cursor between =en= and =fr= via Bing, display the translated result with Overlay
- *ts-2*: translate sentence or selected region near the cursor between =en=, =fr= and =ru= via Google, insert the translated result into current buffer
- *ts-3*: translate all words with length more than 6 in buffer between =en= and =fr= via Google, display the translated result with help echo

The first translator in =gt-preset-translators= will act as the default translator if =gt-default-translator= is nil.
So, translate with command =gt-translate= and switch between preset translators with command =gt-setup=.

See more configuration options via =M-x customize-group go-translate=, and read the following chapters for more configuration details.

** Core Components

The core component of the translation framework is =gt-translator=, which contains the following components:
- =gt-taker=: used to capture user input, including text and languages to be translated
- =gt-engine=: used to translate the content captured by the taker into the corresponding target text
- =gt-render=: used to aggregate results from engines and output them to the user

The flow of translation is =[Input] -> [Translate/Transform] -> [Output]=, corresponding to the components =[Taker] -> [Engine] -> [Render]= above.
Executing the method =gt-start= on the translator will complete a full translation flow.

Therefore, the essence of configuration is to create a translator instance and specify different components according to needs:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; specify components with ':taker' ':engines' and ':render'; run translation with 'gt-start'
  (gt-start (gt-translator :taker ... :engines ... :render ...))

  ;; command 'gt-translate' use the translator defined in 'gt-default-translator' to do its job
  (setq gt-default-translator (gt-translator :taker ... :engines ... :render ..))
  (call-interactively #'gt-translate)
#+end_src

So, one needs to understand these components first for better configuration.

| langs     | Translate languages                                   | List as '(en fr), '(en ru it fr), if empty, use the value  of gt-langs instead                                                |

| pick      | Pick paragraphs, sentences or words from initial text | Function or a symbol like 'word 'paragraph 'sentence etc                                                                      |
| pick-pred | Used to filter the text picked                        | Pass in a string and output a Boolean type                                                                                    |
| then      | The logic to be executed after take. Hook             | A function that takes the current translator as argument. The final modification can be made to the content captured by Taker |
| if        | Validate                                              | Function or literal symbol, used to determine whether taker is available for current translation task                         |

Currently there is only one built-in Taker implementation, which can be used in most scenarios:
: Determine the initial text with 'text',
: determine the translation languages with 'langs',
: confirm with 'prompt',
: and extract certain paragraphs, sentences, or words with 'pick'.

If no Taker is specified or if Taker is specified but lacks options, the values ​​of the following variables will be used as default:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq gt-langs '(en fr))        ; Default translation languages, at least two ​​must be specified
  (setq gt-taker-text 'word)      ; By default, the initial text is the word under the cursor. If there is active region, the selected text will be used first
  (setq gt-taker-pick 'paragraph) ; By default, the initial text will be split by paragraphs. If you don't want to use multi-parts translation, set it to nil
  (setq gt-taker-prompt nil)      ; By default, there is no confirm step. Set it to t or 'buffer if needed
#+end_src

It's better to use =:taker= to explicitly specify a Taker for the translator:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker))
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :langs '(en fr) :text 'word :pick 'paragraph :prompt nil))
  (gt-translator :taker (lambda () (gt-taker))) ; a function
  (gt-translator :taker (list ; a list, use the first available one
                           (gt-taker :prompt t :if 'selection)
                           (gt-taker :text 'paragraph :if 'read-only)
                           (gt-taker :text 'line)))
#+end_src

Taker will use =text= to determine the initial text. If there is active region, the selected text is taken. Otherwise use the following rules:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; It can be a symbol, then use logic like 'thing-at-thing' to take the text
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :text 'word))      ; current word (default)
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :text 'buffer))    ; current buffer
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :text 'paragraph)) ; current paragraph
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :text t))          ; interactively choose a symbol, then take by the symbol

  ;; If it's a string or a function that returns a string, use it as the initial text
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :text "hello world"))                        ; just the string
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :text (lambda () (buffer-substring 10 15)))) ; the returned string
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :text (lambda () '((10 . 15)))))             ; the returned bounds
#+end_src

Taker determine the languages to translate from =langs= in the help of =gt-lang-rules=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :langs '(en fr)))    ; between English and French
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :langs '(en fr ru))) ; between English, French and Russian
  (setq gt-polyglot-p t) ; If this is t, then multilingual translation will be performed, i.e., translated into multiple languages ​​at once and the output aggregated
#+end_src

By setting =prompt= to allow the user to modify and confirm the initial text and languages interactively:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Confirm by minibuffer
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :prompt t))

  ;; Confirm by new buffer
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :prompt 'buffer))
#+end_src

Finally, the initial text is cut and filtered based on =pick= and =pick-pred=. The content it returns is what will ultimately be translated:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; It can be a symbol like those used by text slot
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker ; translate all paragraphs in the buffer
                         :text 'buffer
                         :pick 'paragraph))
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker ; translate all words longer than 6 in the paragraph
                         :text 'paragraph
                         :pick 'word :pick-pred (lambda (w) (length> w 6))))

  ;; It can be a function. The following example is also translating words longer than 6 in current paragraph.
  ;; More complex and intelligent pick logic can be implemented
  (defun my-get-words-length>-6 (text)
    (cl-remove-if-not (lambda (bd) (> (- (cdr bd) (car bd)) 6))
                      (gt-pick-items-by-thing text 'word)))
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :text 'paragraph :pick #'my-get-words-length>-6))

  ;; Use ':pick 'fresh-word' to pick unknown word only for translation
  ;; With commands 'gt-record-words-as-known/unknown' to add word to known/unknown list
  (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :text 'paragraph :pick 'fresh-word))
#+end_src

The built-in Engine implementations are:
- =gt-deepl-engine=, DeepL Translate
- =gt-bing-engine=, Bing Translate
- =gt-google-engine/gt-google-rpc-engine=, Google Translate
- =gt-chatgpt-engine=, translate with ChatGPT
- =gt-youdao-dict-engine/gt-youdao-suggest-engine=, 有道翻译，有道近义词
- =gt-stardict-engine=, StarDict，for offline translate
- =gt-libre-engine=, LibreTranslate, support both online and offline translate
- =gt-osxdict-engine=, invoke Dictionary.app through command osx-dictionary, for offline translate on macOS

Specify engines for translator via =:engines=. A translator can have one or more engines, or you can specify a function that returns the engines:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator :engines (gt-google-engine))
  (gt-translator :engines (list (gt-google-engine) (gt-deepl-engine) (gt-chatgpt-engine)))
  (gt-translator :engines (lambda () (gt-google-engine)))
#+end_src

If a engine has multiple parsers, you can specify one through =parse= to achieve specific parsing, such as:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator :engines
                 (list (gt-google-engine :parse (gt-google-parser))           ; detail results
                       (gt-google-engine :parse (gt-google-summary-parser)))) ; brief results
#+end_src

You can use =if= to filter the engines for current translation task. For example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator :engines
                 (list (gt-google-engine :if 'word)                      ; Enabled only when translating a word
                       (gt-bing-engine :if '(and not-word parts))        ; Enabled only when translating single part sentence
                       (gt-deepl-engine :if 'not-word :cache nil)        ; Enabled only when translating sentence; disable cache
                       (gt-youdao-dict-engine :if '(or src:fr tgt:fr)))) ; Enabled only when translating French
#+end_src

You can specify different caching policies for different engines with =cache=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator :engines
                 (list (gt-youdao-dict-engine)         ; use default cacher
                       (gt-google-engine :cache nil)   ; disable cache
                       (gt-bing-engine :cache 'word))) ; cache for word only
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
*Notice:*

If `delimit' is non-nil, translate multiple parts will use strategy:
1. join the parts into a single string,
2. translate the whole string through the engine,
3. then split the result into parts.

The text passed to the Engine for translation should be a single string.

Otherwise, a list of strings will be passed to the engine, and the engine should have the ability to process the string list.

The built-in Render implementations:
- =gt-render=, the default implementation, will output the results to Echo Area
- =gt-buffer-render=, open a new Buffer to render the results (*recommended*)
- =gt-posframe-pop-render=, open a childframe at the current position to render the results
- =gt-posframe-pin-render=, use a childframe window with fixed position on the screen to render the results
- =gt-insert-render=, insert the results into current buffer
- =gt-overlay-render=, displays the results through Overlay
- =gt-kill-ring-render=, save the results to Kill Ring
- =gt-alert-render=, display results as system notification with the help of [[https://github.com/jwiegley/alert][alert]] package

Configure render for translator via =:render=. Multiple renders can be chained together with =:then=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator :render (gt-alert-render))
  (gt-translator :render (gt-alert-render :then (gt-kill-ring-render))) ; display as system notification then save in kill ring
  (gt-translator :render (lambda () (if buffer-read-only (gt-buffer-render) (gt-insert-render)))) ; a function return render
#+end_src

The first available render in the list (validate conjunction with =:if=) can be used as the final render. For example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator
   :render (list (gt-posframe-pop-render :if 'word) ; if current translation text is word, render with posframe
                 (gt-alert-render :if '(and read-only not-word)) ; if text is not word and buffer is readonly, render with alert
                 (gt-buffer-render)))               ; default, render with new buffer
#+end_src

** Extension Components
*** gt-http-backend

The network request is sent with the help of the [[https://github.com/lorniu/pdd.el][pdd.el]] package. It use the built-in =url.el= to send requests.

If you prefer =curl=, just ensure =curl= and package [[https://github.com/alphapapa/plz.el][plz]] are on your system, then specify ~gt-http-backend~ to ~(pdd-curl-backend)~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; specify client explicitly
  (setq gt-http-backend (pdd-url-backend))  ; base on url.el (default)
  (setq gt-http-backend (pdd-curl-backend)) ; base on curl

  ;; specify client with proxy explicitly
  (setq gt-http-backend (pdd-url-backend :proxy "socks5://127.0.0.1:9876"))

  ;; specify client and proxy separately
  (setq gt-http-backend (pdd-curl-backend))
  (setq gt-http-proxy "socks5://127.0.0.1:1080")

  ;; also, you can config client or proxy dynamically
  (setq gt-http-proxy
        (lambda (request)
          (when (string-match-p "\\(xxx\\)\\.com" (oref request url))
            "socks5://127.0.0.1:1080")))
#+end_src

*** gt-taker with prompt

If prompt via minibuffer, the following keys exist in minibuffer:
- =C-n= and =C-p= switch languages
- =C-l= clear input
- =C-g= abort translate

If prompt via buffer, the following keys exist in the taking buffer:
- =C-c C-c= submit translate
- =C-c C-k= abort translate
- Other keys like switch languages and components please refer to tips on buffer mode line

*** gt-stardict-engine

This is an offline translation engine that supports plug-in dictionaries.

First, make sure [[https://github.com/Dushistov/sdcv][sdcv]] has been installed on your system:
: sudo pacman -S sdcv

In addition, download the dictionary files and put them to the correct location.

After that, configure and use the engine:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Basic configuration
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator :engines (gt-stardict-engine)
                       :render (gt-buffer-render)))

  ;; More options can be specified
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator :engines (gt-stardict-engine
                                 :dir "~/.stardict/dic" ; specify data file location
                                 :dict "dict-name"      ; specify a dict name
                                 :exact t)              ; exact, do not fuzzy-search
                       :render (gt-buffer-render)))
#+end_src

*NOTE*: If rendering via Buffer-Render etc, you can switch between dictionaries by click dictionary name or error message (or press =C-c C-c= on it).

*** gt-deepl-engine

DeepL requires =auth-key= to work, please obtained it through the official website.

The =auth-key= can then be set in the following ways:

1. Specify directly in the engine definition:

   #+begin_example
   (gt-translator :engines (gt-deepl-engine :key "***"))
   #+end_example

2. Save it in =.authinfo= file of OS:

   #+begin_example
   machine api.deepl.com login auth-key password ***

*** gt-chatgpt-engine

Please obtained the apikey through the official website first.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Provide apikey with one of following ways:
  (setq gt-chatgpt-key "YOUR-KEY")
  (gt-chatgpt-engine :key "YOUR_KEY")
  (find-file "~/.authinfo") ; machine api.openai.com login apikey password [YOUR_KEY]

  ;; Others
  (setq gt-chatgpt-model "gpt-3.5-turbo")
  (setq gt-chatgpt-temperature 0.7)
#+end_src

Custom the translation prompt as you wish:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq gt-chatgpt-user-prompt-template
        (lambda (text lang)
          (format "Translate text to %s and return the first word. Text is: \n%s"
                  (alist-get lang gt-lang-codes) text)))
#+end_src

Even can custom the prompt for other tasks. For example, for polish sentence:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my-command-polish-using-ChatGPT ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((gt-chatgpt-system-prompt "You are a writer")
          (gt-chatgpt-user-prompt-template (lambda (text _)
                                             (read-string
                                              "Prompt: "
                                              (format "Polish the sentence below: %s" text)))))
      (gt-start (gt-translator
                 :engines (gt-chatgpt-engine :cache nil)
                 :render (gt-insert-render)))))
#+end_src

It support streaming output with some renders. Examples:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Three engines, one with streaming query, two for normal
  ;; The streaming result can be output with buffer render, posframe render and insert render
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :pick nil)
                       :engines (list (gt-chatgpt-engine :stream t)
                                      (gt-chatgpt-engine :stream nil)
                                      (gt-google-engine))
                       :render (gt-buffer-render)))

  ;; Translate and insert the streaming results to buffer
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator :taker (gt-taker :pick nil :prompt t)
                       :engines (gt-chatgpt-engine :stream t)
                       :render (gt-insert-render)))
#+end_src

After all, try text to speech with command =gt-speak=.

*** gt-buffer-render

Display the translation results with a new buffer. This is a very general way of displaying results.

In the result buffer, there are many shortcut keys (overview through =?=), such as:
- Switch languages via =t=
- Switch multi-language mode via =T=
- Clear caches with =C=
- Refresh via =g=
- Quit via =q=

Alternatively, play speech via =y= (command =gt-speak=). If the active region exists, then only
speak current selection content. TTS requires that the engine have implemented =gt-speech= method.
Command =gt-speak= can use anywhere else, then it will try to speak text via TTS service of system.

You can set the buffer window through =buffer-name/window-config/split-threshold=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-translator :render (gt-buffer-render
                          :buffer-name "abc"
                          :window-config '((display-buffer-at-bottom))
                          :then (lambda (_) (pop-to-buffer "abc"))))
#+end_src

Here are some usage examples:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Capture content under cursor, use Google to translate word, use DeepL to translate sentence, use Buffer to display the results
  ;; This is a very practical configuration
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator
         :taker (gt-taker :langs '(en fr) :text 'word)
         :engines (list (gt-google-engine :if 'word) (gt-deepl-engine :if 'not-word))
         :render (gt-buffer-render)))

  ;; A command for translating multiple paragraphs in the Buffer into multiple languages ​​and rendering into new Buffer
  ;; This shows the use of translation of multi-engines with multi-paragraphs and with multi-languages
  (defun demo-translate-multiple-langs-and-multiple-parts ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((gt-polyglot-p t)
          (translator (gt-translator
                       :taker (gt-taker :langs '(en fr ru) :text 'buffer :pick 'paragraph)
                       :engines (list (gt-google-engine) (gt-deepl-engine))
                       :render (gt-buffer-render))))
      (gt-start translator)))
#+end_src

*** gt-posframe-pop-render/gt-posframe-pin-render

You need to install [[https://github.com/tumashu/posframe][posframe]] before you use these renders.

The effect of these two Renders is similar to =gt-buffer-render=, except that the window is floating.
The shortcut keys are similar too, such as =q= to quit.

You can pass any params to =posframe-show= with =:frame-params=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (gt-posframe-pin-render :frame-params (list :border-width 20 :border-color "red"))
#+end_src

*** gt-insert-render

Insert the translation results into current buffer.

The following types can be specified (=type=):
- =after=, the default type, insert the results after the cursor
- =replace=, replace the translated source text with the results

If not satisfied with the default output format and style, adjust it with the following options:
- =sface=, propertize the source text with this face after the translation is complete
- =rfmt=, the output format of the translation result
- =rface=, specify a specific face for the translation results

The option =rfmt= is a function or a string containing the control character =%s=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; %s is a placeholder for translation result
  (gt-insert-render :rfmt " [%s]")
  ;; One argument, that is the translation result
  (gt-insert-render :rfmt (lambda (res) (concat " [" res "]")))
  ;; Two arguments, the first one is the source text
  (gt-insert-render :rfmt (lambda (stext res)
                            (if (length< stext 3)
                                (concat "\n" res)
                              (propertize res 'face 'font-lock-warning-face)))
                    :rface 'font-lock-doc-face)
#+end_src

Here are some usage examples:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Translate by paragraph and insert each result at the end of source paragraph
  ;; This configuration is suitable for translation work. That is: Translate -> Modify -> Save
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator
         :taker (gt-taker :text 'buffer :pick 'paragraph)
         :engines (gt-google-engine)
         :render (gt-insert-render :type 'after)))

  ;; Translate the current paragraph and replace it with the translation result
  ;; This configuration is suitable for scenes such as live chat. Type some text, translate it, and send it
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator
         :taker (gt-taker :text 'paragraph :pick nil)
         :engines (gt-google-engine)
         :render (gt-insert-render :type 'replace)))

  ;; Translate specific words in current paragraph and insert the result after each word
  ;; This configuration can help in reading articles with some words you don't know
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator
         :taker (gt-taker :text 'paragraph
                          :pick 'word
                          :pick-pred (lambda (w) (length> w 6)))
         :engines (gt-google-engine)
         :render (gt-insert-render :type 'after
                                   :rfmt " (%s)"
                                   :rface '(:foreground "grey"))))
#+end_src

*** gt-overlay-render

Use Overlays to display translation results.

Set the display mode through =type=:
- =after=, the default type, displays the translation results after the source text
- =before=, displays the translation results before the source text
- =replace=, overlays the translation results on top of the source text
- =help-echo=, display result only when the mouse is hovered over the source text

It is similar to =gt-insert-render= in many ways, including options:
- =sface=, propertize the source text with this face after the translation is complete
- =rfmt=, the output format of the translation result
- =rface/rdisp=, specify face or display for the translation results
- =pface/pdisp=, specify face or display for the translation prefix (language and engine prompts)

Here are some usage examples:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Translate all paragraphs in buffer and display the results after the original paragraphs in the specified format
  ;; This is a configuration suitable for reading read-only content such as Info, News, etc.
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator
         :taker (gt-taker :text 'buffer :pick 'paragraph)
         :engines (gt-google-engine)
         :render (gt-overlay-render :type 'after
                                    :sface nil
                                    :rface 'font-lock-doc-face)))

  ;; Mark all qualified words in the Buffer and display the translation results when hover over them
  ;; This is a practical configuration, suitable for reading articles that contains unfamiliar words
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator
         :taker (gt-taker :text 'buffer :pick 'word :pick-pred (lambda (w) (length> w 5)))
         :engines (gt-google-engine)
         :render (gt-overlay-render :type 'help-echo)))

  ;; Use overlays to overlay the translated results directly on top of the original text
  ;; Use this configuration for an article to get its general idea quickly
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator
         :taker (gt-taker :text 'buffer)
         :engines (gt-google-engine)
         :render (gt-overlay-render :type 'replace)))
#+end_src

It is flexible, even something like real-time translation can be implement with the help of hook or timer.

*** gt-text-utility

Derived from =gt-translator=, integrates a lot of text conversion and processing features.

This demonstrates the extensibility of the framework, shows that it can be used not only for translation.

To generate QR code for text, need to install the =qrencode= program or =qrencode= package first:
#+begin_src sh
  pacman -S qrencode
  brew install qrencode

  # or in Emacs
  M-x package-install qrencode
#+end_src

In addition, other functionalities can be integrated by extending the generic method =gt-text-util=.

Here are some usage examples:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; By default, interactivelly choose what to do with the text
  ;; Notice: you should not specify any engine for it
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-text-utility :render (gt-buffer-render)))

  ;; Generate QR Code for current text (specify the `utility' explicitly with :langs)
  ;; Very practical configuration for sharing text to Mobile phone
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-text-utility
         :taker (gt-taker :langs '(qrcode) :pick nil)
         :render (gt-buffer-render)))

  ;; Output text to speech label and MD5 sum
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-text-utility
         :taker (gt-taker :langs '(speak md5) :text 'buffer :pick 'paragraph)
         :render (gt-posframe-pin-render)))
#+end_src

*** gt-valid-trait (:if)

Component =gt-taker=, =gt-engine= and =gt-render= are inherited from =gt-valid-trait=, which
provides a way to determine component availability through =:if= slot. This greatly simplifies
the configuration of translator for different scenarios.

The value of the slot =:if= can be a function, a symbol or a list of forms linked by and/or.
Symbol can be prefixed with =not-= or =no-= to indicate a reverse determination.

Some symbols built-in:
- =word= translated text is word
- =src:en= source language is English
- =tgt:en= target language is English
- =parts= multiple parts text to be translated
- =read-only= current buffer is read only
- =selection= current use region is active
- =emacs-lisp-mode= suffix with *-mode*, that match with current mode
- =not-word= or =no-word= reverse determination, translated text *is not* word

One simple config example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; for text selected, not pick, render with posframe
  ;; for buffer Info, translate current paragraph, render with overlay
  ;; for buffer readonly, translate all fresh word in buffer, render with overlay
  ;; for Magit commit buffer, insert the translated result into current position
  ;; for word, translate with google engine; for non-word, use deepl
  (setq gt-default-translator
        (gt-translator
         :taker   (list (gt-taker :pick nil :if 'selection)
                        (gt-taker :text 'paragraph :if '(Info-mode help-mode))
                        (gt-taker :text 'buffer :pick 'fresh-word :if 'read-only)
                        (gt-taker :text 'word))
         :engines (list (gt-google-engine :if 'word)
                        (gt-deepl-engine :if 'no-word))
         :render  (list (gt-posframe-pop-render :if 'selection)
                        (gt-overlay-render :if 'read-only)
                        (gt-insert-render :if (lambda (translator) (member (buffer-name) '("COMMIT_EDITMSG"))))
                        (gt-alert-render :if '(and xxx-mode (or not-selection (and read-only parts))))
                        (gt-buffer-render))))
#+end_src

** Customization and Extension

The code is based on eieio (CLOS), so almost every component can be extended or replaced.

For example, implement an engine that outputs the captured text in reverse order. It's easy:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; First, define the class, inherit from gt-engine
  (defclass my-reverse-engine (gt-engine)
    ((delimit :initform nil)))

  ;; Then, implement the method gt-execute
  (cl-defmethod gt-execute ((_ my-reverse-engine) task)
    (setf res (cl-loop for c in (oref task text) collect (reverse c))))

  ;; At last, config and have a try
  (setq gt-default-translator (gt-translator :engines (my-reverse-engine)))
#+end_src

For example, extend Taker to let it can capture all headlines in org mode:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; [implement] make text slot of Taker support 'org-headline
  (cl-defmethod gt-thing-at-point ((_ (eql 'org-headline)) (_ (eql 'org-mode)))
    (let (bds)
      (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'headline
        (lambda (h)
          (save-excursion
            (goto-char (org-element-property :begin h))
            (skip-chars-forward "* ")
            (push (cons (point) (line-end-position)) bds))))))

  ;; [usage] config Taker with ':text org-headline' and that's it
  (setq gt-default-translator (gt-translator
                               :taker (gt-taker :text 'org-headline)
                               :engines (gt-google-engine)
                               :render (gt-overlay-render :rfmt " (%s)" :sface nil)))
#+end_src

In this way, use your imagination, you can do a lot.

** Miscellaneous

To enable debug, set =gt-debug-p= to t, then you will see the logs in buffer =*gt-log*=.
